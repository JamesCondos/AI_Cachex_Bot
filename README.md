An AI to play the board game Cachex.
Cachex is a perfect-information two-player board game played on on an n x n rhombic hexagonically tiled board.
The aim of the game is, each turn one player will place a tile, and the first to create a continuous connecting line nof the same color form one end of their board to the other, wins.

There are several rules.
1. Players can 'capture' other players tiles top make them 'dissapear', if a perfect symmetrical diamond of 4 tiles is made (colour sensitive symmetry).
2. The first turn of the entire game cannot place a piece at the centre of the board
